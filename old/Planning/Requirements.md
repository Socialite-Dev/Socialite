### [[Accounts]]
Must be able to login / logout
Must be able to change password
Account creation done by teachers
	Must  be able to do it en-masse from a list of names (and emails? not all schools have them so maybe not use them at all or make them optional)
Accounts must be able to be deleted when the user leaves the school (and be hard to do accidentally)
Accounts are either teachers or students
### [[Friendships]]
Users can request friendship with other users
	Friendship only occurs when the requested user agrees
Posts to walls can only be seen by people who are friends with that wall's owner
Either friend can end the friendship whenever
### [[Posts]]

1. A user's own wall (status updates)
2. The walls of a user's friends
3. Groups that a user is a part of
Posts contain text content
### [[Comments]]
Users can leave text comments on any posts that they can see (effectively meaning they are allowed to make comments on posts in locations they could post to)
Comments are accessible from the post
Comments contain text content
### [[Groups]]
Users can be members of groups
Users can join groups with an invite link or group id
Groups can be created by any user

### [[Safety]]
The above post visibility requirements act to reduce the ability for people to bully others (since friendship or a shared group is required to even interact)
(Some? All?) Teachers can see all students walls
Students can report posts / comments to notify teachers directly
Automatic word filtering?
### Direct Messaging?
(This seems useful but maybe it's one of the last basic requirements)
